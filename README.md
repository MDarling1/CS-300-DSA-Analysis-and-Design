# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem was how to go about store data effectively.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I enjoyed working with this project. Data structures are important to udnerstand because information needs to be 
  able to have the storage space, and the ability to be manipulated easily. 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  Honestly, I would step away from the project for a moment when I needed to gather my thoughts. Sometimes it would 
  help to look at other pieces of code for inspiration, I especially like to utilize the geeksforgeeks webpage.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  I feel like after this course I have a better understanding of both how to code in C++ better, and being able to use VS a little more confidently.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  With this project, I feel like I understand how to code better, which in turn also makes utilizing object-oriented programming skills vastly easier.
